They key is to know that a valid payment has been made via Paypal and then provide a 'delivery' page with links to the customer's newly purchased product(s) or some other format for delivering the product the customer.

In this assignment use a Buy Now button to send payment to PayPal.  Once payment is accepted the Paypal will return your customer to a page that contains link(s) to the purchased products. This is done by adding a Return URL to your button when you create it.

  2. Create a buy now button on the **'products page'** that will accept a fixed payment amount from the customer.
      * The button should include a URL to a **'delivery page'** on your website that will be called when the customer has completed the payment process.
  3. Create a **'cancel page'** for your application.
      * The button should include a URL to a page on your website that will be called if the customer decides to **cancel** their order during the process. 
  4. Create a **'delivey page'** for your application
      * The **'delivery page'** should have links to the following pieces of content. Create your own content reflective of the product you are selling. 
          * A MS Word document.
          * A pdf version of the Word document.
          * An image.
          * A zip file containing the Word document, pdf file and the image
